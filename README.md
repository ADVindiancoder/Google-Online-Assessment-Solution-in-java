# Min Amplitude

## Question 1:
Given an Array A, find the minimum amplitude you can get after changing up to 3 elements. Amplitude is the range of the array (basically the difference between the largest and smallest element).

### Example 1:
Input: [-1, 3, -1, 8, 5, 4] <br>
Output: 2 <br>
Explanation: We can change -1, -1, 8 to 3, 4, or 5. <br>

### Example 2:

Input: [10, 10, 3, 4, 10] <br>
Output: 0 <br>
Explanation: Change 3 and 4 to 10. <br>


## Question 2:
Given a string S, we can split S into 2 strings: S1 and S2. Return the number of ways S can be split such that the number of unique characters between S1 and S2 are the same.

### Example 1:
Input: "aaaa"   <br>
Output: 3  <br>
Explanation: We can get a - aaa, aa - aa, aaa - a.  <br>

### Example 2:
Input: "bac"  <br>
Output: 0  <br>

### Example 3:
Input: "ababa"  <br>
Output: 2  <br>
Explanation: ab - aba, aba - ba.  <br>
